# Applying-Model-Evaluation-Metrics-for-Multiple-Linear-Regression-with-test-train-split
This project applies a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict a car’s Miles per Gallon (MPG) using features like Engine Size, Weight, and Horsepower. It demonstrates how to split data into training and testing sets, train a model, and evaluate performance using R² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
